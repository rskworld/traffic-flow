Urban traffic flow dataset with vehicle counts, speed measurements, and congestion patterns for traffic prediction and smart city applications.

## 📋 Description

This dataset includes traffic flow measurements with vehicle counts, average speeds, congestion levels, and temporal patterns. Perfect for traffic prediction, congestion forecasting, and intelligent transportation systems.

## ✨ Features

- **Vehicle Counts**: Detailed vehicle count data across multiple time periods
- **Speed Measurements**: Average speed data for traffic flow analysis
- **Congestion Patterns**: Traffic congestion level indicators and patterns
- **Multiple Locations**: Data collected from various traffic monitoring points (Downtown, Highway, City Center, Suburbs, Airport)
- **Time Series Format**: Structured time series data for analysis

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Format**: CSV, JSON
- **Category**: Time Series Data
- **Difficulty**: Intermediate
- **Technologies**: CSV, JSON, Pandas, Time Series, Python, Data Visualization

### Dataset Structure

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `timestamp`: Date and time of the measurement
- `location`: Location where the measurement was taken
- `vehicle_count`: Number of vehicles observed
- `avg_speed_kmh`: Average speed in kilometers per hour
- `congestion_level`: Level of congestion (Low, Medium, High)
- `road_type`: Type of road (Urban, Highway, Suburban)
- `direction`: Direction of traffic flow (North, South, East, West)

## 📁 Files

- `traffic_flow_data.csv`: Main dataset in CSV format
- `traffic_flow_data.json`: Dataset in JSON format
- `analyze_traffic_flow.py`: Python script for data analysis
- `index.html`: Interactive web visualization
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
